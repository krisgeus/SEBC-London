Liked the bootcamp a lot.

Learned also a lot, but the learning could have been a lot better when:

* during labs enabling tls was doen with providing a certificate signing authority (the instructors probably)
or a good documented for of creating your own CA.

Lost a full day strugling with TLS in the labs.


* During challenge the bad wifi disabled me from installing java 8.
Had to download through the oracle websote to local machine and had to upload 158MB 5 times. This also held me up so i wasn't able to finish
