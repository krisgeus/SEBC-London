## Changes

No changes made. Put in the real aws numbers of 4 vcores and 15GB for the worker nodes.

Ended up with -1 vcores for yarn to use.
Impossible to change things around to give yarn some air....


Changing the workloadfactor doesn't do anything because the minimum of -1 is still the minimum.
